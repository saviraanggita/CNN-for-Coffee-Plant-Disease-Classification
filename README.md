# CNN for Coffee Plant Disease Classification

The aim of this project is to build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model that can help classify diseases in coffee plants. The CNN model is built using EfficientNet-B0 architecture with Adam optimization algorithm. The performance of the model is compared on an imbalanced dataset (original dataset) and a balanced dataset (augmented dataset).
